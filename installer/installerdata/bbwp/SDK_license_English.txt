(d)	To the extent that Distributable Source Code is provided as part of the SDK, You may use, modify and compile the Distributable Source Code solely for the purposes of developing Your Applications.

(e)	You may distribute any Distributable Code provided that You shall: (i) add significant primary functionality to it in Your Applications; (ii) distribute such code in executable form only; (iii) include the following copyright notice within Your Application's source code in the same locations as Your own copyright notice (and if You do not include a copyright notice, then at least on one of the packaging, manuals or "about" box): "Portions copyright (c) 2002-2010 Research In Motion Limited.  All rights reserved."; (iv) not provide a separate price for or charge a license fee or royalty for the Distributable Code distinct from the fee You charge for Your Applications; and (v) not distribute, link or integrate the Distributable Code such that any part of it becomes subject to an Open Source License.

Neither You nor Your Applications may manipulate or otherwise alter the output of the RIM Base Map Product Offerings or enhance or otherwise alter the functionality offered by the RIM Base Map Product Offerings.  If You wish to develop Applications which offer map-based functionality over and above that available through the RIM Base Map Product Offerings, You may be able to use the "Enhanced map APIs" (if any are provided as part of Your version of the SDK or otherwise) to enable Your Applications to access the TANA Map Products (as same may be reformatted, compressed, adapted, translated or otherwise processed by RIM) which are stored on RIM's infrastructure.  HOWEVER THE TANA MAP PRODUCTS ARE THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE, AND YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO DEVELOP, COMMERCIALLY LAUNCH OR OTHERWISE COMMERCIALLY EXPLOIT ANY APPLICATIONS THAT ACCESS THE TANA MAP PRODUCTS (OTHER THAN AS PART OF THE RIM BASE MAP PRODUCT OFFERINGS AS PROVIDED ABOVE) UNLESS AND UNTIL YOU EXECUTE A LICENSE DIRECTLY WITH TANA GRANTING YOU THE RIGHT TO DO SO.  If no Enhanced map APIs are included in Your version of the SDK You should contact RIM for information as to their availability.
