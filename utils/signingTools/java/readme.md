Instructions for running the tool:
1. Browse to this folder from terminal.
2. run "javac SigningTool.java"
3. run "java SigningTool"

Once the UI appears use the following instructions:
1. 1st and 2nd Key locations are basically your .csj files that you got from the Signing server when you signed up for your keys.
2. BBWP location is location of the BBWP that you get when you install the Webworks for Tablet.
3. csjpin is your pin that you used when you signed up for the keys.
4. cskpass is a password that is generated. I recommend you use this as the same as your csjpin.
5. company name is the company name you used when you signed up for the signing keys.
