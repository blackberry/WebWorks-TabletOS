/**
 * Provides a common base for classes that facilitate the unimpeded execution
 * of subprocesses returned from the <code>exec()</code> methods of class
 * <code>Runtime</code>.
 * <p>
 * Process buffer objects can be constructed with the <code>Process</code>
 * object returned from a call to <code>Runtime.exec()</code>:
 * <pre>
 *     String cmd = ...;
 *     Process p = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(cmd);
 *
 *     //
 *     // Because some native platforms only provide limited buffer size for
 *     // standard output streams, we promptly read the output streams using
 *     // a separate thread so that this thread can proceed without blocking.
 *     // The ProcessBuffer subclasses hide the implementation details.
 *     //
 *     ErrorBuffer stderr = new ErrorBuffer(p);
 *     OutputBuffer stdout = new OutputBuffer(p);
 *     ExitBuffer exitValue = new ExitBuffer(p);
 * </pre>
 * The <code>ErrorBuffer</code> uses a separate thread to read from the
 * standard error stream of the subprocess, and is made available upon
 * reaching the end of the error stream.
 * <p>
 * The <code>OutputBuffer</code> uses a separate thread to read from the
 * standard output stream of the subprocess, and is made available upon
 * reaching the end of the output stream.
 * <p>
 * The <code>ExitBuffer</code> uses a separate thread to wait for completion
 * of the subprocess, at which time the buffer is made available containing
 * the exit value of the subprocess.
 * <p>
 * To block until a buffer is available, use the <code>waitFor()</code>
 * method. To test (or "poll") whether a buffer is available, use the
 * <code>available()</code> method. Details about accessing the actual
 * contents of the buffer are specific to the particular subclass.
