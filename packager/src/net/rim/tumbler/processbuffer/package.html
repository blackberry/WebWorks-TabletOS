This package contains reusable classes that help avoid potential deadlocks
in the subprocesses returned from the <code>exec()</code> methods of class
<code>Runtime</code>. The <code>exec()</code> methods in
<code>java.lang.Runtime</code> return a <code>Process</code> object for
managing the subprocess. As mentioned in the documentation for class
<code>java.lang.Process</code>, failure to promptly read the output stream
of the subprocess may cause the subprocess to block, and even deadlock.
This package helps avoid such deadlocks by providing classes to promptly read
the output stream of the subprocess. These classes use a separate thread in
order to allow the calling thread to proceed without blocking.
